# Binary Tree

List representation of a Binary tree

For a given node at index $i$, the children of that node are $(2*i)+1$ and $(2*i)+2$.

Prperties
* The maximum number of nodes at level L of a binary tree is $2^L$
* The maximum total number of nodes in a binary tree of height $H$ is $2^H â€“ 1$
* Total number of leaf nodes in a binary tree = total number of nodes with 2 children + 1
* In a Binary Tree with $N$ nodes, the minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is $log_2(N+1)$
* A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least $| Log_2L |+ 1$ levels


# Sorting

## Merge sort

split() method

merge() method

Main method
* split the list into half
* Call Main method
* Return merge() result
