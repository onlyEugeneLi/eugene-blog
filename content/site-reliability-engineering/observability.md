# Observability

## Monitoring vs. Observability:

Understanding the distinction between traditional monitoring and the broader concept of observability, which emphasizes understanding system behavior and root causes

## Three Pillars of Observability

logs, metrics, and traces

# Observability and Troubleshooting:

## Root Cause Analysis:
Ability to use Splunk to investigate incidents, identify root causes, and determine the impact on business operations.
## Distributed Tracing:
Experience with using distributed tracing to understand the flow of requests across microservices and identify performance bottlenecks.
## Log Analysis:
Proficiency in using Splunk's search and analysis capabilities to investigate logs and gain insights into application behavior.
## Correlating Data:
Ability to correlate data from different sources (logs, metrics, traces) to gain a holistic view of system performance.


### telemetry/observability tools translates to:
* Improved Incident Response: Faster identification and resolution of issues, reducing downtime and business impact.
* Increased System Reliability: Proactive identification of potential problems before they escalate.
* Better Resource Utilization: Optimized resource allocation based on performance data.
* Enhanced Decision-Making: Data-driven insights to support strategic planning and operational improvements
