# Observability

## Monitoring vs. Observability:

Understanding the distinction between traditional monitoring and the broader concept of observability, which emphasizes understanding system behavior and root causes

## Three Pillars of Observability

logs, metrics, and traces

# Observability and Troubleshooting:

## Root Cause Analysis:
Ability to use Splunk to investigate incidents, identify root causes, and determine the impact on business operations, preventing recurrences
## Distributed Tracing:
Experience with using distributed tracing to understand the flow of requests across microservices and identify performance bottlenecks.
## Log Analysis:
Proficiency in using Splunk's search and analysis capabilities to investigate logs and gain insights into application behavior.
## Correlating Data:
Ability to correlate data from different sources (logs, metrics, traces) to gain a holistic view of system performance.


### telemetry/observability tools translates to:
* Improved Incident Response: Faster identification and resolution of issues, reducing downtime and business impact.
* Increased System Reliability: Proactive identification of potential problems before they escalate.
* Better Resource Utilization: Optimized resource allocation based on performance data.
* Enhanced Decision-Making: Data-driven insights to support strategic planning and operational improvements


## Explain log levels and their significance

Log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) indicate the severity of events, helping prioritize issues during troubleshooting.


## Monitoring Metrics

**Latency**: \
The time it takes to respond to a request. Lower latency is better, indicating faster response times.

**Traffic**:  \
The amount of demand placed on the system. Understanding traffic patterns helps in capacity planning and resource allocation.

**Errors**: \
The rate at which requests fail. High error rates indicate potential problems that need to be addressed.

**Saturation**: \
The degree to which resources (CPU, memory, etc.) are being utilized. High saturation can lead to performance degradation.

**Availability**: The percentage of time a service is operational and accessible. 

**Throughput**: The rate at which a system processes requests or transactions. 

**Resource Utilization**: The consumption of system resources like CPU, memory, and disk space
