Model-View-Controller (MVC) Framework

An architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller.

Model (Data): The backend that contains all the data logic

View (UI): The frontend or graphical user interface (GUI)

Controller (Brain): The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed
